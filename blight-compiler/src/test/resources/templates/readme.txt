The files in this directory are used to test the compiler.
There are a mix of unprocessed and compiled templates.

When editing the files (especially the ones containing expected compiler
outputs) you will need to use a text editor which doesn't perform any automatic 
manipulation of whitespace, new line or tab characters.
